Meeting 11/9

1. Remove all features withr 0 sequence reads.
2. Also remove ones with less than 0.1% total of the sum!
3. Include back the important ones.
4. Overlay histogram to see interaction.
5. STacked bar chart of important features.
6. Heatmap correlaton within msm and msw
7. Feature level descriptive analysis, mean, median.
8. is there any particular bacteria, that contributes to the model.

Use msm or msw as the outcome, and we can try different models to fit. 


Paired correlation.




Meeting 11/16

Look for all comparable variables in the two sets // completed the diagrams
pca for the feature importance // done
regression techniques to find out feature importance
lefsie method // not done
also explore machine learning methods for feature analysis.
complete all the plts // wait
heatmap spearman    // left to complete
complete the taxa as is in rachel's document. //done
Use msm or msw as the outcome, and we can try different models to fit. //done


meeting 11/30

1. change the distplot in relative abundance
2. all the machine learning.
--------------
Update:
Correlation map changed based on relative abundance(still need to do it in R)
All the machine learning algorithms have been applied on the rel_abundance data


Research questions and techniques used?

1. Relative abundance -- because individuals have varying sequence counts, relative proportion is always helpful.
2. Centered log ratio(taxa) -- is used to separate out and reduce collinearity between the taxa (check for multicollinearity)
3. non-parametric method(we are not assuming normality) - spearman correlation.
4. Predict msm/msw based on the taxa (rf,lr,nb,also use elastic net)
5. for the outcome variables check spearman correlation.
5.5 Log transform the cytokines but report the normal values.
6. MSM/MSW difference in outcome variables using non-parametric wilcoxon rank sum test.
7 Regress separately for all of them.(check for normality of error-- normality test)
8. multiple testing (false discovery)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other ideas:
1. Stratify msm and msw and then regress against each of the cytokines.
2. Draw a random forest MSM/MSW taxa importance vs Linear Regression taxa importance using that graph!




3/27/19

1. Use all taxa:  use rf to get gini index.
2. repeat this using elastic net.
3. regression  bacteria cytokines.
4. add status : same regression : use aic for model selection.
5. go for interaction


4/5/19

1. We select the top taxa for MSM and MSW which accounts for appx 90% of the abundance.
