ANALYSIS METHODS USED


## SELECTING SAMPLES FOR AMKAJ MICROBIOME ANALYSIS

Step 1 : Draw a histogram of sequence counts for all the taxa. Remove taxa with lowest sequence counts.
Step 2 : Delete Taxa with zero reads.
Step 3 : Select top 45 genus level taxa that accounts for at least 0.1% of taxa across all observations and add
         in the putative pathogens that aren't in the top 45.(i.e. Chlamydia,Neisseria, Treponema)
Step 4 : Select top 10 taxa from the final selected based on relative abundance and classify the rest as 'OTHER'.


## EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS (tt : top ten)

1. Compare RA for tt taxa for MSM and MSW.
2. Check correlation between taxa for MSM and MSW(Spearman-Correlation)
3. Check correlation between cytokines for MSM and MSW(Spearman Correlation)

## DATA TRANSFORMATION  
1. The genus level taxa data is transformed using centered log-ratio transformation (Compositional data).
2. Cytokine data is log transformed.

## CYTOKINE COMPARISON MSM AND MSW
1. The cytokines of MSM and MSW are compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (non-parametric t-test)

## STATUS vs BACTERIAL COMPOSITION
1. Random Forest and Logistic Regression is used to predict status of an individual regressing against bacterial compositon.

## BACTERIAL COMPOSITION VS CYTOKINES
1. Linear regression with bacterial composition as predictor and cytokines as outcome.

## VARIABLE/MODEL SELECTION
1. Forward Selection  -- 

## MULTIPLE TESTING CORRECTION
1. False Discovery Rate --
