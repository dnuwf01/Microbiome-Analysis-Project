Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV and STIs as compared to men who have sex with women (MSWo). We compared the penile microbiome of MSM to that of MSWo, to identify differences in penile microbiome composition, and whether these differences were associated with mucosal inflammation.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 43 HIV negative MSM in Kisumu, Kenya. From a contemporaneously ongoing cohort study of the penile microbiome of MSWo, we randomly selected 43 MSWo who were matched to MSM on age and circumcision status, from their baseline visit. The penile microbiome was assessed via a shallow meatal swab, with 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 regions. Urinary cytokine concentrations were measured using the Luminex LabMAP multiplex system. After filtering and normalization, Random Forest (RF) with 5-fold cross validation was used to identify genus level taxa differing between MSM and MSWo. Taxa were regressed on cytokine outcomes, with multiple testing correction.
